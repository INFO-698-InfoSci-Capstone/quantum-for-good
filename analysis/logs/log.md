# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

### Number of hours: 
Since the kickoff meeting on February 19, 2025, I have spent well over 100 hours, at least, on the project. While my three meetings with mentor Sarah Young totaled only around four hours, most of my time was dedicated to collecting and reading articles to develop a ueeful research topic.

### Rose:
Meeting with one of the founders of the quantum startup 'DiffraQtion' was exciting and gave me new insights into real-world applications of quantum technology and the challenges deep tech startups are currently facing. 

### Bud: 
I have another meeting scheduled with my mentor on March 31 to finalize my topic for the Workshop on Responsible Quantum Innovation, which will take place at UCLA on May 27–28. I’m looking forward to refining my focus and preparing for the event.

### Thorn: 
Identifying a focused subject within quantum technology has been challenging due to its vast and complex nature. Since the field is still in its early stages, most of the topics I originally considered rely heavily on assumptions, making it difficult to predict the future of the technology. However, that uncertainty is also what makes the topic so exciting.

## Additional thought
Recommended Readings: Law and Policy in the Quantum Age, The Quantum Internet.

### Number of hours: 
About 30-40 hrs

### Rose:
Exploring the real-world policy implications of quantum technology has been deeply engaging. I especially enjoyed learning about China’s success with the Micius satellite, which demonstrates how geopolitical power is already being shaped by quantum innovation. Observing the intersection of science, national strategy, and global competition has deepened my understanding of the critical role policy design plays in this emerging field.

### Number of hours: 
30 hrs

### Rose:
Finally locked in the project topic, “Quantum for Good? Not Without Return,” and submitted my poster proposal along with resume on Tuesday.

### Bud: 
The poster selection process is scheduled for Friday. Once the proposal is chosen, there will be an opportunity for the project to be showcased and potentially developed further. The topic explores the investment trend in quantum technology companies, many of them have not yet generated profit, raising fundamental questions about long-term value, risk, and the intersection of science, hype, and, most importantly, sustainability.

### Thorn: 
A main concern is whether the research will lead to useful results. The topic is complex, and it’s important to find insights that can actually help startups in the quantum tech. field. It is a good challenge to make the project both clear and meaningful.

### Number of hours: 
Appr. 30 hrs.

### Rose:
More indepth research has begun with a focus on identifying more of relevant quantum tech companies, marking a productive step forward. 

### Bud: 
The poster selection process was scheduled for last Friday, but there has been no update from Sarah yet.

### Thorn: 
The same Thorn still exists, and it will be until the day the research is completed.

### Number of hours: 
Appr. 20 hrs.

### Rose:
I received great news that my poster proposal was rated among the top five by the CFP judges, which was a meaningful affirmation of the work so far.
I’ve been invited to attend the UCLA workshop and may also have the opportunity to moderate a panel, offering a meaningful way to engage more deeply with the event.

### Bud:
Although the poster session was canceled due to unexpected NSF funding cuts, the workshop is still moving forward. 
There’s potential to contribute in other ways, like bringing a poster voluntarily or helping as a panel moderator. Needs further updates.

### Thorn:
The same concern remains: whether the research will ultimately lead to actionable insights that can support early stage quantum startups.

### Number of hours: 
Appr. 20 hrs.

### Rose:
This week, I have been focused on finalizing the poster and continuing research on investment trends in quantum tech startups.

### Bud:
I’m exploring alternative ways to contribute, such as bringing the poster informally or serving as a panel moderator. 
These possibilities are still open and could provide a valuable platform to share insights and engage with others in the field.

### Thorn:
The same concern remains: whether the research will ultimately lead to actionable insights that can support early stage quantum startups.
